        <h4>How do I solve these puzzle games?</h4>
        <p>If you&rsquo;ve never heard of puzzlehunts before, here&rsquo;s a very brief summary: in a typical puzzle, you receive some information and have to extract an answer out of it, which is almost always an English word or phrase. Puzzles can come in many different forms; the only real commonality is that you usually receive no direct instructions, so it&rsquo;s up to you to figure out how to make sense of the information you&rsquo;re given.</p>
        <p>If you are new to puzzles and are interested in seeing some examples, or if you&rsquo;re looking for some practice, we recommend looking at puzzles from other online hunts such as the <a target="_blank" href="https://caltechpuzzlehunt.org/">Caltech Puzzle Hunt</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://puzzlepotluck.com/">Puzzle Potluck</a>.</p>

        <h4>How do we collaborate virtually?</h4>
        <p>Although it's harder to do so virtually, collaboration makes puzzling much more fun and productive!
            We suggest that teams try different web-based collaboration tools
            such as Google Docs and Google Sheets. Zoom is
            convenient for making video calls and has breakout room features in case
            your team members want to work on different tasks. While video
            calling, one team member can also screenshare and use Zoom, PowerPoint,
            or other annotation tools to work on puzzles and show their work!</p>

      <h4>I&rsquo;m stuck on a puzzle. What should I do?</h4>
      <p>Here are some general puzzle tips that might be useful:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Thoroughly check the work that you&rsquo;ve already done. Fixing a small mistake or incorrect assumption can greatly help with getting unstuck.</li>
        <li>Get fresh eyes on the puzzle, or conversely, take a break and look at something else.</li>
        <li>Consider what information you haven&rsquo;t used yet.</li>
        <li>It can be useful to put everything you have into your favorite search engine.</li>

      <h4>Can I write code that interacts with the puzzles / server?</h4>
      <p>This will not be necessary to complete any aspect of the puzzlehunt.
         However, if you want to do this, please limit any automated requests to at most 1/second for our server&rsquo;s sake. We may disqualify teams that egregiously violate this request.</p>
